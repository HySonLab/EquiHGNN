# EquiHGNN: Scalable Rotationally Equivariant Hypergraph Neural Networks

## Abstract

Molecular interactions often involve high-order relationships that cannot be fully captured by traditional graph-based models limited to pairwise connections. Hypergraphs naturally extend graphs by enabling multi-way interactions, making them well-suited for modeling complex molecular systems. In this work, we introduce EquiHGNN, an Equivariant Hypergraph Neural Network framework that integrates symmetry-aware representations to improve molecular modeling. By enforcing equivariance under relevant transformation groups, our approach preserves geometric and topological properties, leading to more robust and physically meaningful representations. We examine a range of equivariant architectures and demonstrate that integrating symmetry constraints leads to notable performance gains on large-scale molecular datasets. Experiments on both small and large molecules show that high-order interactions offer limited benefits for small molecules but consistently outperform 2D graphs on larger ones. Adding geometric features to these high-order structures further improves performance, emphasizing the value of spatial information in molecular learning.

## Datasets

This project currently utilizes four main datasets:

- **OPV**: The Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) dataset contains molecular structures and their corresponding photovoltaic properties.
- **QM9**: The QM9 dataset consists of small molecules with geometric, energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties.
- **PCQM4Mv2**: From the PubChemQC project, this dataset of ~3.7M molecules supports quantum chemistry tasks like predicting HOMOâ€“LUMO gaps from SMILES; useful for materials discovery and drug design.
- **Molecule3D**: Also based on PubChemQC, this benchmark includes ~3.9M molecular graphs for predicting 3D structures and quantum properties from 2D inputs, supporting applications in molecular modeling and property prediction.

## Setup

First, create and activate a Conda environment:

```shell
conda create --name equihgnn python=3.10
conda activate equihgnn
make
```

## Train the Model

Training parameters, including model type, dataset selection, and hyperparameters, are configurable within the `./scripts` directory. A flexible interface allows easy model selection using the `--method` flag. The following models are supported:

- `gin`, `gat`: 2D Graph Neural Network.
- `mhnnm`: Molecular Hypergraph Neural Network (baseline).
- `egnn_equihnns`: Equivariant Graph Neural Network (EGNN) integration for geometric feature extraction.
- `equiformer_equihnns`: Equiformer integration for geometric feature extraction.
- `faformer_equihnns`: Frame Averaging Transformer (FAFormer) integration for geometric feature extraction.
