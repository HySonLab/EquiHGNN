# 3D Geometric Hypergraph Neural Network

## Dataset

This project currently utilizes two main datasets:

- **OPV Dataset**: The Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) dataset contains molecular structures and their corresponding photovoltaic properties.
- **QM9 Dataset**: The QM9 dataset consists of small molecules with geometric, energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties.

## Environment Setup

Create the environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```


## Models


## Run Code

To train and evaluate the models, use the following commands:

1. **Training**:

```bash
bash scripts/run_opv.sh
```
